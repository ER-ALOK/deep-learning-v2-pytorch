Neural networks with non-linear activations work like universal function approximators. There is some function that maps your input to the output. For example, images of handwritten digits to class probabilities. The power of neural networks is that we can train them to approximate this function, and basically any function given enough data and compute time.\n","\n","<img src=\"assets/function_approx.png\" width=500px>\n","\n","At first the network is naive, it doesn't know the function mapping the inputs to the outputs. We train the network by showing it examples of real data, then adjusting the network parameters such that it approximates this function.\n","\n","To find these parameters, we need to know how poorly the network is predicting the real outputs. For this we calculate a **loss function** (also called the cost), a measure of our prediction error. For example, the mean squared loss is often used in regression and binary classification problems\n","\n","$$\n","\\large \\ell = \\frac{1}{2n}\\sum_i^n{\\left(y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\right)^2}\n","$$\n","\n","where $n$ is the number of training examples, $y_i$ are the true labels, and $\\hat{y}_i$ are the predicted labels.\n","\n","By minimizing this loss with respect to the network parameters, we can find configurations where the loss is at a minimum and the network is able to predict the correct labels with high accuracy. We find this minimum using a process called **gradient descent**. The gradient is the slope of the loss function and points in the direction of fastest change. To get to the minimum in the least amount of time, we then want to follow the gradient (downwards).

Through the `nn` module, PyTorch provides losses such as the cross-entropy loss (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`). You'll usually see the loss assigned to `criterion`. As noted in the last part, with a classification problem such as MNIST, we're using the softmax function to predict class probabilities. With a softmax output, you want to use cross-entropy as the loss. To actually calculate the loss, you first define the criterion then pass in the output of your network and the correct labels.\n","\n","Something really important to note here.

The general process with PyTorch:\n","\n","* Make a forward pass through the network \n","* Use the network output to calculate the loss\n","* Perform a backward pass through the network with `loss.backward()` to calculate the gradients\n","* Take a step with the optimizer to update the weights\n","\n","Below I'll go through one training step and print out the weights and gradients so you can see how it changes. Note that I have a line of code `optimizer.zero_grad()`. When you do multiple backwards passes with the same parameters, the gradients are accumulated. This means that you need to zero the gradients on each training pass or you'll retain gradients from previous training batches."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"I7FeEG1nB8Cl","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":309},"outputId":"96aed450-b0b5-4c66-f877-d7039118150c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1576729860857,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":2595,"user":{"displayName":"say vortana","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBJuDooKxk_3q_a_tgv2B0w_hNR-94GxRtJj2vbQf4=s64","userId":"17870030538444629428"}}},"source":["print('Initial weights - ', model[0].weight)\n","\n","images, labels = next(iter(trainloader))\n","images.resize_(64, 784)\n","\n","# Clear the gradients, do this because gradients are accumulated\n","optimizer.zero_grad()\n","\n","# Forward pass, then backward pass, then update weights\n","output = model(images)\n","loss = criterion(output, labels)\n","loss.backward()\n","print('Gradient -', model[0].weight.grad)"],"execution_count":43,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Initial weights -  Parameter containing:\n","tensor([[-0.0119,  0.0276,  0.0212,  ..., -0.0215, -0.0324, -0.0034],\n","        [-0.0355,  0.0275,  0.0318,  ..., -0.0182,  0.0116, -0.0142],\n","        [ 0.0107, -0.0052, -0.0270,  ..., -0.0247, -0.0042,  0.0184],\n","        ...,\n","        [ 0.0296,  0.0256,  0.0273,  ...,  0.0355,  0.0132,  0.0348],\n","        [ 0.0025, -0.0355, -0.0186,  ...,  0.0286,  0.0065,  0.0137],\n","        [ 0.0276,  0.0029, -0.0114,  ..., -0.0196,  0.0224, -0.0134]],\n","       requires_grad=True)\n","Gradient - tensor([[ 0.0006,  0.0006,  0.0006,  ...,  0.0006,  0.0006,  0.0006],\n","        [-0.0042, -0.0042, -0.0042,  ..., -0.0042, -0.0042, -0.0042],\n","        [ 0.0001,  0.0001,  0.0001,  ...,  0.0001,  0.0001,  0.0001],\n","        ...,\n","        [ 0.0014,  0.0014,  0.0014,  ...,  0.0014,  0.0014,  0.0014],\n","        [ 0.0015,  0.0015,  0.0015,  ...,  0.0015,  0.0015,  0.0015],\n","        [ 0.0012,  0.0012,  0.0012,  ...,  0.0012,  0.0012,  0.0012]])\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"cfecm9BSB8Cn","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":190},"outputId":"206decab-e60c-46ec-c316-9b42988bd7d3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1576729860857,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":2579,"user":{"displayName":"say vortana","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBJuDooKxk_3q_a_tgv2B0w_hNR-94GxRtJj2vbQf4=s64","userId":"17870030538444629428"}}},"source":["# Take an update step and few the new weights\n","optimizer.step()\n","print('Updated weights - ', model[0].weight)"],"execution_count":44,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Updated weights -  Parameter containing:\n","tensor([[-0.0119,  0.0276,  0.0212,  ..., -0.0215, -0.0324, -0.0034],\n","        [-0.0354,  0.0276,  0.0319,  ..., -0.0182,  0.0116, -0.0142],\n","        [ 0.0107, -0.0052, -0.0270,  ..., -0.0248, -0.0042,  0.0184],\n","        ...,\n","        [ 0.0296,  0.0256,  0.0273,  ...,  0.0355,  0.0132,  0.0348],\n","        [ 0.0025, -0.0355, -0.0186,  ...,  0.0286,  0.0065,  0.0137],\n","        [ 0.0276,  0.0029, -0.0114,  ..., -0.0196,  0.0224, -0.0134]],\n","       requires_grad=True)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"D3IGlCT8B8Cp","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Training for real\n","\n","Now we'll put this algorithm into a loop so we can go through all the images.
